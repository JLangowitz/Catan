Not all rule violation will throw errors, the game assumes the honor system in several places. This also requires that players already know how to play Catan.

To run the game go into /CatanServer and run app.py

This will start the server, then go to your browser of choice (Only tested in Chrome) and go to the URL displayed in your terminal. 

Enter the player names (3-6) in the follwoing format.
Emily, Ankeet, Josh, Brooks

The game will enter set up, at which point players should take turns placing 1 settlement and 1 road at a time.
Do not press next turn during the setup phase, it will end early.

To place a settlement,  click on the desired vertex.

Once the settlement is placed, the available roads will highlight. To place the road click on the desired, highlighted, edge. 

Once setup has been completed, play the game as normal. Building works the same as in setup, click on a vertex to show available building options and click on the highlighted building to build it. 

To trade with another player (on you turn) click on the trade button next to their name and select the desired resources to trade. To trade with the bank, click the trade button associated with your name.

When a 7 is rolled, players will be asked to discard cards (Discarding at all/the right number of cards is on the honor system). The player that rolled the 7 should then choose the tile to move the robber to by clicking on a tile. A dialog will pop up with all players on that hex, choose one to take a random card from them. That hex will now grey out until the robber is moved again.
